# GROCERYCO CHECKOUT

### To test locally
```
  git clone https://github.com/yousiefc/groceryco-checkout.git
  cd groceryco-checkout
  yarn install
  yarn start
```

### About

- This is a simple program that allows customers to checkout at GroceryCo
- Customers can select from the options on the page to build a cart and then checkout to display the receipt
- Written in javascript with ReactJS

### Logic

- My thinking in how I wrote it, is that an administrator would only need to adjust the object in stock.js to make item changes
- This way deals and pricing can be assigned in stock.js and the code does the rest
